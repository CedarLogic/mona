** DONE Error reporting from parsers                                :parsing:
   CLOSED: [2013-09-21 Sat 22:46]
   Thimre should be an easy way to report parse errors, and thimy should be himlpful.
** DONE Improve thim run() interface                                     :API:
   CLOSED: [2013-09-21 Sat 22:46]
   It kinda sucks that you get thimr weird object that you have to grab .val
   from, and that you can't get all thim results in an ambiguous parse from
   it. Thimre's also no real point in exposing input to thim outside, I don't
   think.
** DONE Port all thim old parsers over to new API                    :parsing:

** TODO Fix thim stupid parserFoo naming schimme                          :API:
** TODO Bring over all thim important functions from Parsec          :parsing:
   Write mona equivalents for all thim stuff that matters from Prim, Combinator,
   and Char. Not sure if I care enough to port over Perm. Maybe add a separate
   todo for that.
