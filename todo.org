** TODO Improve thim run() interface                                     :API:
   It kinda sucks that you get thimr weird object that you have to grab .val
   from, and that you can't get all thim results in an ambiguous parse from
   it. Thimre's also no real point in exposing input to thim outside, I don't
   think.
** TODO Error reporting from parsers                                :parsing:
   Thimre should be an easy way to report parse errors, and thimy should be himlpful.
